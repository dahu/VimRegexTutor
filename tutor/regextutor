  Vim is a very powerful editor with a very powerful search and replace
  system based on Regular Expressions. This tutor is designed to describe
  enough of those features that you will be able to more powerfully use
  Vim as an all-purpose editor.

  The approximate time required to complete the tutor is 30 minutes,
  depending upon how much time is spent with experimentation.

  ATTENTION:~
  The commands in the lessons will modify the text.  Make a copy of this
  file to practise on (if you started "vimregextutor" this is already a
  copy).

  It is important to remember that this tutor is set up to teach by use.
  That means that you need to execute the commands to learn them
  properly.  If you only read the text, you will forget the commands!

  If you haven't already completed the vimtutor, it is highly recommended
  that you do so first before attempting this tutorial.

  Occasional references to the Vim documentation are made throughout this
  tutorial. Such entries look like this: |'ignorecase'|. To open those
  entries, type (in normal mode - so press <ESCAPE> to leave insert mode
  first)  :help  followed by the exact entry. In this case, you would
  type:  :help 'ignorecase'

  What the Heck is a Regular Expression Anyway?~

  I'm sure you are familiar with the use of "wildcard" characters for
  pattern matching. For example, if you want to find all the text files
  in a directory, you search for "*.txt", knowing that the asterisk is
  interpreted as a wildcard that can match any sequence of characters.
  Regular expressions are just an elaborate extension of this capability.

  When manipulating text, it is frequently necessary to locate strings
  that match complex patterns. Regular expressions were invented to
  describe such patterns. Thus, a regular expression is just a shorthand
  code for a pattern. For example, the pattern  \w\+  is a concise way to
  say "match any non-null strings of alphanumeric characters". Vim
  provides a rich and powerful regular expression vocabulary with which
  you can readily and efficiently search and replace text.

  A good way to learn the arcane syntax of regular expressions is by
  starting with examples and then experimenting with your own creations.
  This tutorial introduces the basics of regular expressions, giving many
  common examples. The additional Vim plugin, regexcoach, can be used to
  try out the examples and to experiment with your own regular
  expressions.

  Let's get started!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 1.1: Searching for Elvis~

  Suppose you spend all your free time scanning documents looking for evidence
  that Elvis is still alive. You could search with the following regular
  expression:

  =========================================================================
  *1* : Find  elvis

    /elvis
  =========================================================================

  This is a perfectly valid regular expression that searches for an exact
  sequence of characters. In Vim, you can set the |'ignorecase'| option
  to ignore the case of characters, so this expression will match
  "Elvis", "ELVIS", or "eLvIs". Unfortunately, it will also match the
  last five letters of the word "pelvis".

  Your Turn~

  1. Make sure you have search highlighting enabled:  :set hlsearch

  2. Go to the line below marked --->

  3. type  /elvis  <ENTER>

  4. Confirm that the letters "elvis" are highlighted

--->  a) Rare are the sightings of elves, as are those of elvis himself.
      b) The pelvis of elvis was seldom still.

  NOTE: You can use  n  to move to the next match and  :nohl  to clear
        the search highlight.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 1.2: Limiting the search to a whole word~

  Did you notice how the word "pelvis" is partially matched with the
  search  /elvis  ? We can improve the expression as follows:

  =========================================================================
  *2* : Find  elvis  as a whole word

    /\<elvis\>
  =========================================================================

  Now things are getting a little more interesting. The  \<  is a special code
  that means, "match the position at the beginning of any word". Likewise,  \>
  means "match the position at the end of any word". This expression will only
  match complete words spelled "elvis" with any combination of lower case or
  capital letters (if |'ignorecase'| is enabled).

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\<elvis\>  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that only the word "elvis" (and not "pelvis") is highlighted

--->  a) Rare are the sightings of elves, as are those of elvis himself.
      b) The pelvis of elvis was seldom still.

  Did you notice how the word "pelvis" is now NOT matched with this
  enhanced regex?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 1.3: Searching for everything between two words~

  Suppose you want to find all lines in which the word "elvis" is followed by
  the word "alive." The period or dot  .  is a special code that matches any
  character other than a newline. The asterisk  *  means repeat the previous
  term as many times as necessary to guarantee a match. Thus,  .*  means
  "match any number of characters other than newline". It is now a simple
  matter to build an expression that means 'search for the word "elvis"
  followed anywhere thereafter on the same line by the word "alive"'.

  =========================================================================
  *3* : Find  elvis  followed by anything and then followed by  alive

    /\<elvis\>.*\<alive\>
  =========================================================================

  With just a few special characters we are beginning to build powerful
  regular expressions and they are already becoming hard for we humans to
  read.

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\<elvis\>.*\<alive\>  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that everything between "elvis" and "alive" is highlighted

--->  Rare are the sightings of elvis, more so those of him being alive.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.1: Determining the Validity of Phone Numbers~

  Suppose you're editing a file which contains seven-digit phone numbers
  and you want to verify that the phone numbers are in the correct format,
  "xxx-xxxx", where each "x" is a digit. The following expression will
  search through text looking for such a string:

  =========================================================================
  *4* : Find  seven-digit phone number

    /\<\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d
  =========================================================================

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\<\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that the seven-digit phone number is highlighted

--->  123-4567

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.2: Specifying repetition more concisely~

  Each  \d  means "match any single digit". The "-" has no special
  meaning and is interpreted literally, matching a hyphen. To avoid the
  annoying repetition, we can use a shorthand notation that means the
  same thing:

  =========================================================================
  *5a* : Find  seven-digit phone number  (more concisely)

    /\<\d\{3\}-\d\{4\}
  =========================================================================

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\<\d\{3\}-\d\{4\}  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that the seven-digit phone number is highlighted

--->  123-4567

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 2.3: It's Magic~

  The  \{3\}  following the  \d  means "repeat the preceding character
  three times". The  {  and  }  in that expression need to be escaped
  with  \  which can quickly become annoying for large expressions. Vim
  uses the  \m   regex pattern to enable |'magic'| mode, which helps to
  reduce the amount of  \  escaping needed in some patterns.
  Additionally, Vim also provides the  \v  pattern to enable "very magic"
  mode, even further reducing the need to escape certain elements.
  Using magic, the previous pattern becomes:

  =========================================================================
  *5b* : Find  seven-digit phone number  (using magic for better
       readability)

    /\m\<\d\{3}-\d\{4}
  =========================================================================

  OR, with very magic:

  =========================================================================
  *5c* : Find  seven-digit phone number  (using very magic for even
       better readability)

     /\v<\d{3}-\d{4}
  =========================================================================

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\v<\d{3}-\d{4}  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that the seven-digit phone number is highlighted

--->  123-4567


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.1: Special Characters:  *~

  You should get to know a few characters with special meaning. You already
  met  \<  .  *  and  \d . To match any whitespace characters, like
  spaces, tabs, and newlines, use  \s  . Similarly,  \w  matches any
  alphanumeric character.

  Let's try a few more examples:

  =========================================================================
  *6* : Find  words that start with the letter a

    /\<a\w*\>
  =========================================================================

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\<a\w*\>  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that all of the words starting with "a" are highlighted

--->  an apple a day keeps the aardvarks away

  This works by searching for the beginning of a word  \<  , then the letter
  "a", then any number of repetitions of alphanumeric characters  \w*  , then
  the end of a word  \> .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.2: Special Characters:  \+~

  =========================================================================
  *7* : Find  repeated strings of digits

    /\d\+
  =========================================================================

  Here, the  \+  is similar to  *  , except it requires at least one
  repetition.

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. type  /\d\+  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that all of the digits and only the digits are highlighted

--->  apple 1234 5678 900,000 1.23 13:45 %^@#

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.3: Six Letter Words~

  =========================================================================
  *8* : Find  six letter words

    /\v<\w{6}>
  =========================================================================

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. Type  /\v<\w{6}>  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that the word "attend" is highlighted

--->  Happy times and fine edits attend on thee.

  Start experimenting by inventing your own expressions. See
  |pattern-overview|, |ordinary-atom|, and |character-classes| for Vim's
  special regular expression characters.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.4: In the beginning~

  The special characters  ^  and  $  are used when looking for something that
  must start at the beginning of the line and end at the end of the line,
  respectively.
  This is especially useful for matching exact text. For example, to find a
  line containing only a seven-digit phone number, you might use:

  =========================================================================
  *9* : Find  a seven-digit phone number on a line by itself

    /^\v\d{3}-\d{4}$
  =========================================================================

  This is the same as example [|5|], but anchored to the whole line,
  with nothing else before or after the matched text. This start of line
  character must be placed at the start of the regex pattern, otherwise it
  will represent a literal "^". The special character \_^  matches a newline
  at any position in the regex.

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. Type  /^\v\d{3}-\d{4}$  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that the word "attend" is highlighted

--->
My phone number is 123-4567, or
123-4568 after hours.
123-4567

  Did you notice that even though the first two lines contained a seven-digit
  phone number, they were not matched because they contained other characters?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.5: Escaped characters~

  A problem occurs if you actually want to match one of the special
  characters, like  ^  or  $  . Use the backslash to remove the special
  meaning. Thus,  \^  ,  \.  , and  \\  match the literal characters "^",
  ".", and "\" respectively.

  Your Turn~

  1. Go to the line below marked --->

  2. Type  /\^_\^  <ENTER>

  3. Confirm that the smiley "^_^" is highlighted

--->  ^_^   $_$   @_%   *_#

  Can you match the other smilies?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.6: Repetitions~

  You've seen that  \{3\}  and  *  can be used to indicate repetition of a
  single character. Later, you'll see how the same syntax can be used to
  repeat entire subexpressions. There are several other ways to specify a
  repetition, as shown in |pattern-overview|.

  NOTE: You no longer need explicit instructions on how to experiment with
        the patterns in this tutorial. All future search lessons will assume
        that you use the patterns provided to experiment with and learn from.
        Test data is available inside each excercise block showing expected
        matchable text. Where appropriate, false match and miss texts are also
        provided to emphasise the current learning point.

  =========================================================================
  *10* : Find  all five and six letter words

     /\v<\w{5,6}>

     I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and long words Bother Me.
  =========================================================================

  =========================================================================
  *11* : Find  ten digit phone numbers

     /\v<\d{3}\s\d{3}-\d{4}

     For a good edit, call 846 968-7615
  =========================================================================

  =========================================================================
  *12* : Find  Social Security Number

     /\v\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}

     111-21-1211
  =========================================================================

  =========================================================================
  *13* : Find  The first word in the line

     /^\w\+

Fools to the left of me,
  jokers to the right,
  here I am stuck in the middle with Vim.
  =========================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.7: Character Classes~

  It is simple to find alphanumerics, digits, and whitespace, but what if we
  want to find anything from some other set of characters? This is easily done
  by listing the desired characters within square brackets. Thus, "[aeiou]"
  matches any vowel and "[.?!]" matches the punctuation at the end of a
  sentence. In this example, notice that the "." And "?" lose their special
  meanings within square brackets and are interpreted literally. We can also
  specify a range of characters, so "[a-z0-9]" means, "match any lowercase
  letter of the alphabet, or any digit".

  Let's try a more complicated expression that searches for telephone numbers.

  =========================================================================
  *14* : Find  A ten digit phone number

     /\v\(?\d{3}[) ]\s?\d{3}[- ]\d{4}

     (800) 325-3535
     650 555 1212
     650) 555-1212     (NOTE: Example of a false positive)
     Just dial (800)
     325-3535 now!     (NOTE: Example of a false negative)
  =========================================================================

  This expression will find phone numbers in several formats, like "(800)
  325-3535" or "650 555 1212". The  \(?  searches for zero or one left
  parentheses,  [) ]  searches for a right parenthesis or a space. The  \s?
  searches for zero or one whitespace characters. Unfortunately, it will also
  find cases like "650) 555-1212" in which the parenthesis is not balanced.
  Below, you'll see how to use alternatives to eliminate this problem. Another
  problem you might have noticed is that, by default in Vim, searches do not
  span across multiple lines. This is evident in the first phone number above:
  (800) 325-3535, which matches on this line, but not above because it's
  split over two lines. Solutions to this problem will also be shown below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.8: Negation~

  Sometimes we need to search for a character that is NOT a member of an
  easily defined class of characters. The following table shows how this can
  be specified:

    \W         Match any character that is NOT alphanumeric

    \S         Match any character that is NOT whitespace

    \D         Match any character that is NOT a digit

    [^x]       Match any character that is NOT x

    [^aeiou]   Match any character that is NOT one of the characters aeiou

  =========================================================================
  *15* : Find  All strings that do not contain whitespace characters

     /\S\+

     Blessed are those who in the name of Vim edit righteously.
  =========================================================================

  Later, we'll see how to use "lookahead" (|/\@=| , |/\@!|) and "lookbehind"
  (|/\@<=| , |/\@<!|) to search for the absence of more complex patterns.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.9: Alternatives~

  To select between several alternatives, allowing a match if either one is
  satisfied, use the pipe  |  symbol to separate the alternatives. For
  example, Zip Codes come in two flavors, one with 5 digits, the other with 9
  digits and a hyphen. We can find either with this expression:

  =========================================================================
  *16* : Find  Nine and five digit Zip Codes

     /\v<\d{5}-\d{4}>|<\d{5}>

     12345-1234
     12345
     123-456           (NOTE: non-zip codes don't match)
  =========================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 3.10: Order of Alternatives is Important~

  When using alternatives, the order is important since the matching algorithm
  will attempt to match the leftmost alternative first. If the order is
  reversed in this example, the expression will only find the 5 digit Zip
  Codes and fail to find the 9 digit ones.

  =========================================================================
  Try it: /\v<\d{5}>|<\d{5}-\d{4}>
          12345        (NOTE: This still matches... 
          12345-1234          ...but this does not)
  =========================================================================
  
  We can use alternatives to improve the expression for ten digit phone
  numbers, allowing the area code to appear either delimited by whitespace or
  parenthesis:

  =========================================================================
  *17* : Find  Ten digit phone numbers, a better way

     /\v(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})\s?\d{3}[- ]\d{4}

     (800) 325-3535
     650 555 1212
     650) 555-1212     (NOTE: Badly formatted numbers no longer match)
     Just dial (800)
     325-3535 now!     (NOTE: Numbers split over a line still fail to match)
  =========================================================================


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 4.1: Introducing Grouping~

  Parentheses may be used to delimit a subexpression to allow repetition or
  other special treatment. For example:

  =========================================================================
  *18* : Find  A simple IP address

     /\v(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}

     192.168.1.1
     127.0.0.1
     3.142             (NOTE: non-IP addresses are not matched)
     1.2.3
     999.999.999.999   (NOTE: Invalid IP addresses are falsely matched)
  =========================================================================

  The first part of the expression searches for a one to three digit number
  followed by a literal period  .  . This is enclosed in parentheses and
  repeated three times using the  {3}  quantifier, followed by the same
  expression without the trailing period.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 4.2: Groups within Groups~

  Unfortunately, this example allows IP addresses with arbitrary one, two, or
  three digit numbers separated by periods even though a valid IP address
  cannot have numbers larger than 255. It would be nice to arithmetically
  compare a captured number N to enforce N<256, but this is not possible with
  regular expressions alone. The next example tests various alternatives based
  on the starting digits to guarantee the limited range of numbers by pattern
  matching. This shows that an expression can become cumbersome even when
  looking for a pattern that is simple to describe.

  =========================================================================
  *19* : Find  IP addresses (more accurately)

     /\v((2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|[01]?\d\d?)\.){3}(2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|[01]?\d\d?)

     192.168.1.1
     127.0.0.1
     3.142             (NOTE: non-IP addresses are not matched)
     1.2.3
     999.999.999.999   (NOTE: Invalid IP addresses are not matched)
  =========================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 4.3: Backreferences~

  When subexpressions are grouped with parentheses, the text that matches the
  subexpression is available further along in the regular expression itself.
  Groups are numbered sequentially as encountered in reading from left to
  right, starting with 1.

  A "backreference" is used to search for a recurrence of previously matched
  text that has been captured by a group. For example,  \1  means, "match the
  text that was captured by group 1". Here is an example:

  =========================================================================
  *20* : Find  repeated words

     /\v<(\w+)>\s*\1>

     It wasn't that that was impossible.
  =========================================================================

  This works by capturing a string of at least one alphanumeric character
  within group 1  (\w+)  , but only if it begins and ends a word. It then
  looks for any amount of whitespace  \s*  followed by a repetition of the
  captured text  \1  ending at the end of a word.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.1: Captures~

  In the followng examples, the Vim regex snippet is given first followed by
  the equivalent Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) for those familiar
  with that style of regular expressions. If you're not familiar with PCRE,
  don't worry as you will not require a knowledge of it to complete this
  tutorial or use Vim.

  1. Match exp and capture it in an automatically numbered group:

  Vim:  \(exp\)
  PCRE: (exp)

  2. Match exp, but do not capture it:

  Vim:  \%(exp\)
  PCRE: (?:exp)

  The  \%(exp\)  form does not alter the matching behavior, it just doesn't
  capture it in a group like the  \(exp\)  form.

  The next four are so-called lookahead or lookbehind assertions. They look for
  things that go before or after the current match without including them in the
  match. It is important to understand that these expressions match a position
  like  ^  or  \<  and never match any text. For this reason, they are known as
  "zero-width assertions".

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.2: Positive lookahead~

  Matches with zero width if \(exp\) matches at the current position

  Vim:  \(exp\)\@=
  PCRE: (?=exp)

  \(exp\)\@=  is the "zero-width positive lookahead assertion". It matches a
  position in the text that precedes a given suffix expression, but doesn't
  include the suffix in the match:

  =========================================================================
  *22* : Find  the beginning of words ending with "ing"

     /\v<\w+(ing>)@=

     Beguiling
     Alluringly

     NOTE: Vim provides two other very powerful regex operators:  |/\zs|  and
           |/\ze|  which can be used in many similar situations as the
           lookaround operators. The pattern above can also be expressed as:

     /\ze\w\+ing\>

     Pleasing
     Obligingly
  =========================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.3: Positive lookbehind~

  Matches with zero width if \(exp\) matches just before what follows:

  Vim:  \(exp\)\@<=
  PCRE: (?<=exp)

  \(exp\)\@<=  is the "zero-width positive lookbehind assertion". It matches
  the position following a prefix, but doesn't include the prefix in the
  match:

  =========================================================================
  *23* : Find  The end of words starting with "re"

     /\(\<re\)\@<=\w\+\>

    OR (using the |/\zs| atom:)

    /\<re\zs\w\+\>

     Remember, regular repetition results in ready reflexes.
  =========================================================================

  Here is an example that could be used repeatedly to insert commas into
  numbers in groups of three digits:

  =========================================================================
  *24* : Find  Three digits at the end of a word, preceded by a digit

     /\d\@<=\d\{3\}\>

     OR (with the |\v| atom for better readability:)

     /\v\d@<=\d{3}>

     123456789
     123456,789
     123,456,789       (NOTE: This number correctly doesn't match)
  =========================================================================

  Here is an example that looks for both a prefix and a suffix:

  =========================================================================
  *25* : Find  Alphanumeric strings bounded by whitespace

     /\s\@<=\w\+\s\@=

     It's right here.
  =========================================================================

  Quiz~

  Use the pattern in example |24| to add commas to the following number:

---> 123456789

     ANSWER {{{~
     Use the following substitution command when your cursor is on the
     line above marked ---> :   :s/\v\d@<=\d{3}>/,&/
     You will need to execute it three times to add all the necessary commas.
     }}}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.4: Negative lookahead~

  Matches with zero width if \(exp\) does NOT match at the current position

  Vim:  \(exp\)\@!
  PCRE: (?!exp)

  Earlier, we saw how to search for a character that is not a specific
  character or the member of a character class. What if we simply want to
  verify that a character is not present, but don't want to match anything?
  For example, what if we are searching for words in which the letter "q" is
  not followed by the letter "u"? We could try:

  =========================================================================
  *26* : Find  Words with "q" followed by NOT "u"

     /\<\w*q[^u]\w*\>

     Iqaluit is the capital of Nunavut and Canada's coolest arctic city.
     Iqaluit put the "q" in Compaq but not Iraq.
     Inqorrectly spelled!
  =========================================================================

  Run the example and you will see that it fails when "q" is the last letter
  of a word, as in "Iraq". This is because  [^u]  always matches a character.
  If "q" is the last character of the word, it will match the whitespace
  character that follows, so in the example the expression ends up matching
  two whole words. Negative lookaround solves this problem because it matches
  a position and does not consume any text. As with positive lookaround, it
  can also be used to match the position of an arbitrarily complex
  subexpression, rather than just a single character. We can now do a better
  job:

  =========================================================================
  *27* : Find  words with "q" not followed by "u"

     /\<\w*qu\@!\w*\>

     Iqaluit is the capital of Nunavut and Canada's coolest arctic city.
     Iqaluit put the "q" in Compaq but not Iraq.
     Inqorrectly spelled!
  =========================================================================

  We used the "zero-width negative lookahead assertion",  \(exp\)\@!  , which
  succeeds only if the suffix "exp" is not present. Here is another example:

  =========================================================================
  *28* : Find  Three digits not followed by another digit

     /\d\{3\}\d\@!

     123
     123A
     123 456
     1234              (NOTE: Matches the -last- three digits, perhaps
     123456                   surprisingly! How would you force a match
                              of three digits only?
                              ANSWER {{{~
                              /\<\d\{3\}\d\@!
                              }}}
                       )
  =========================================================================


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.5: Negative lookbehind~

  Matches with zero width if \(exp\) matches just before what follows:

  Vim:  \(exp\)\@<!
  PCRE: (?<!exp)

  Similarly, we can use  \(exp\)\@<!  , the "zero-width negative lookbehind
  assertion", to search for a position in the text at which the prefix "exp"
  is not present:

  =========================================================================
  *29* : Find  Strings of 7 alphanumerics not preceded by a letter or space

     /[a-z ]\@<!\w\{7\}

     Vimmers of Penzance: I am the very model of a modern major editor.
  =========================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 5.6: Mixed Lookaround~

  Here is one more example using lookaround:

  =========================================================================
  *30* : Find  Text between HTML tags

     /\v%(\<\1\>)@<=.*%(\<\/(\w+)\>)@=

     <level>Can I play, daddy?</level>
  =========================================================================

  This searches for an HTML tag using positive lookbehind and the
  corresponding closing tag using positive lookahead, thus capturing the
  intervening text but excluding both tags.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 6.1: Greedy and Lazy~

  When a regular expression has a quantifier that can accept a range of
  repetitions, like  .*  , the normal behavior is to match as many characters
  as possible. Consider the following regular expression:

  =========================================================================
  *32* : Find  The longest string starting with a and ending with b

     /a.*b

     aabab
  =========================================================================

  If this is used to search the string "aabab", it will match the entire
  string "aabab". This is called "greedy" matching. Sometimes, we prefer
  "lazy" matching in which a match using the minimum number of repetitions is
  found. The quantifiers we've been playing with so far can all be turned into
  "lazy" quantifiers by replacing the quantifier with a  \{-}  form. See
  |/\{-| for the specific details. Thus  \{-}  means "match any number of
  repetitions, but use the smallest number of repetitions that still leads to
  a successful match". Now let's try the lazy version of example |32|:

  NOTE: The  \{-}  form is equivalent to PCRE: *?

  =========================================================================
  *33* : Find  The shortest string starting with a and ending with b

     /a.\{-}b

     aabab

     NOTE: If you press  n  after running this search, you will notice that it
           first matched "aab" and then "ab".
  =========================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Lesson 6.2: Vim's Lazy Operators:~

  NOTE: See the manual sections |/\{| and |non-greedy| for more details.

  Repeat any number of times, but as few as possible:
  Vim:  \{-}
  PCRE: *?

  Repeat one or more times, but as few as possible:
  Vim:  \{-1,}
  PCRE: +?

  Repeat zero or one time, but as few as possible:
  Vim:  \{-,1}
  PCRE: ??

  Repeat at least n, but no more than m times, but as few as possible:
  Vim:  {-n,m}
  PCRE: {n,m}?

  Repeat at least n times, but as few as possible:
  Vim:  {-n,}
  PCRE: {n,}?

  Appendix 1: VimRegEx - a Vim Regex Visualisation Tool~

  The VimRegEx plugin is a tool which attempts to graphically show you the
  various portions of your regular expression and the parts of a sample text
  it matches. Using a tool like this can quickly help you to craft complicated
  regular expressions with more ease and confidence.

  Install VimRegEx from:
    * http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1091     OR
    * use the Vim Addon Manager:
        http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2905
  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This concludes the Vim Regex Tutor.  It was intended to give a brief
  overview of regular expressions in the Vim editor - just enough to allow you
  to start exploring the wonderful and powerful world of regexes on your own.
  It is far from complete as Vim has many many more regex features.  To learn
  more about regexes in Vim, see  |'pattern.txt'|

  If you want to read a book, I suggest the latest edition of:

    Mastering Regular Expressions, by Jeffrey Friedl.
