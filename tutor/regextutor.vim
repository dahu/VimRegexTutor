" Vim regextutor support file
" Maintainer:  Barry Arthur <barry.arthur@gmail.com>
" Last Change: 2011 Jul 22

" NOTE: This was shamelessly stolen from Eduardo F. Amatria's
" (<eferna1@platea.pntic.mec.es>) original tutor.vim.
" None of the language varients exist for vimregextutor yet, but Eduardo's
" code was left here in the vain hope that one day it would be useful. :)

" This Vim script is used for detecting if a translation of the
" regextutor file exists, i.e., a regextutor.xx file, where xx is the
" language.  If the translation does not exist, or no extension is given, it
" defaults to the English version.

" It is invoked by the vimregextutor shell script.

" 1. Build the extension of the file, if any:
let s:ext = ""
if strlen($xx) > 1
  let s:ext = "." . $xx
else
  let s:lang = ""
  " Check that a potential value has at least two letters.
  " Ignore "1043" and "C".
  if exists("v:lang") && v:lang =~ '\a\a'
    let s:lang = v:lang
  elseif $LC_ALL =~ '\a\a'
    let s:lang = $LC_ALL

    let s:lang = $LANG
  endif
  if s:lang != ""
    " Remove "@euro" (ignoring case), it may be at the end
    let s:lang = substitute(s:lang, '\c@euro', '', '')
    " On MS-Windows it may be German_Germany.1252 or Polish_Poland.1250.  How
    " about other languages?
